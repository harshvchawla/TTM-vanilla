        <p>Why tech?</p>
        <p>Our world is increasingly driven by technology -- it’s all around us, and it changes how we interact with the
          world
          and each other. Technical literacy is widely considered one of the most important 21st century skills, and it
          is a
          passport into participation in the modern economy. Tech skills are consistently one of the most in-demand
          skill sets.
